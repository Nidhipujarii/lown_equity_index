# Video Presentation Of The Project


# Project
# GOAL

Our goal is to conduct comprehensive research to identify top-performing hospitals in key domains, including charity care, optimal care, hospital performance, pay equity, support for low-income patients, and overall hospital quality. Additionally, we aim to categorize hospitals based on their profit status (for-profit or non-profit) and examine their geographic distribution, distinguishing between rural and urban locations within Alabama. Ultimately, our objective is to determine which hospitals consistently achieve the highest average ranks across these diverse metrics, serving as beacons of excellence and social responsibility within the healthcare industry.
